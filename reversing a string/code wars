Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
def lovefunc(a,b):
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        return False
    elif a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        return True
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

Removing spaces from a string
def no_space(x):
    return x.replace(" ", "")

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"
def find_needle(haystack):
    returnâ€™found the needle at position {}'.format(haystack.index('needle'))

You need to double the integer and return it..split

def double_integer(i):
    double = i * 2
    return(double)

Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

def make_upper_case(s):
    bob = str.upper(s)
    return(bob)

our goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
def remove_char(s):
    bob = s[1:-1]
    return(bob)


You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones
def positive_sum(arr):
    return sum(x for x in arr if x > 0)
